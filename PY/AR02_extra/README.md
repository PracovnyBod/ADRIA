## Simulation in code
- These codes should serve as inspiration or a template for how to structure your code, if you decided to follow the path of righteousness and would want to do your simulations in code instead of Simulink.

### Description
There are two folders: `script`, `oop`.
- `script` contains a "simple" Python script that simulates the system response
- `oop` contains an object-oriented approach to the simulation (for those interested in the OOP approach in Python)

### Run
To run the simulation, you need to have all the necessary modules from `requirements.txt` installed. The specific version of the modules is not a requirement. The environment is not created by this example, it is up to the user how and where the modules will be installed.

If all the necessary modules are installed, then the simulation can be run in the specific folder:
- `script`: run `CV2_simple_script.py` (IDE, terminal, command prompt, ...)
- `oop`: run `CV2_main.py`(IDE, terminal, command prompt, ...)
